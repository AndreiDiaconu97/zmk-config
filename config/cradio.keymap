/* TODO
- LAYER SWITCHING IDEAS:
    - HOLD alpha keys (slower, but more keys available)
        - similar alternative is TAP-HOLD
    - press COMBOs of alphas (much faster, but have to avoid common sequences, and too much chordind causes fatigue)
- Mod-tap with no delay and retro-tap vs &lt? --> could not use &lt since is laggier
- put as much functionality on left hand so that I can use mouse without much switching
- find GOOD backspace position. Find fast way to delete one word
- Do I really need dedicated right homerow mods for nav layer? It seems so...
- find a use for double thumb combos (30 31), (32 33), (30 33), (31 32), (30 32), (31 33)
- move GUI to lower pinkies?
